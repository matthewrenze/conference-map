```

The following is an interactive map of the conferences that I have spoken at or am scheduled to speak at, as of May 12, 2017.

To create this map, we'll use the following R code.
``` {r, fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 5.5, warning = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

setwd("C:/Work/School/Products/Projects/Project 2")

conferences <- read.csv("Conferences.csv")

map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng = conferences$lon,
    lat = conferences$lat,
    popup = conferences$Location)

map
```

Please click on a marker to see the name of the city of a conference that I've spoken at.
